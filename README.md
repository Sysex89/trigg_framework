# trigg_framework


A little C framerowk designed to help developers write code for [Trigg](https://github.com/fablabnk/trigg) (a.k.a [Sprig](https://github.com/hackclub/sprig))


### Overview
This project is designed for the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller.


### Prerequisites
- A Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller.
- Installed [Pico SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk) on your development environment.
- A C/C++ build system (e.g., `cmake`).


### Getting Started
- _TBD_
<!-- 1. Clone the repository and set up the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK as described in the [official documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/c_sdk.html).
2. Compile the code using `cmake`:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```
3. Flash the compiled binary to the Raspberry Pi Pico using your preferred method (e.g., USB mass storage or `picotool`). -->
